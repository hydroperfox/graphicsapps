# Graphics apps

The following software are what I know as good for creating and editing graphics.

* In-depth RGBA bitmap editing = (open source = [Photopea](https://photopea.com/)) + (commercial = Photoshop)
* Scalable vector graphics = (open source = Inkscape) + (commercial = Illustrator) + (commercial = Animate)
